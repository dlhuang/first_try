   touch readme
   git add readme
   git commit -m 'first commit'
   git remote add origin git@github.com:dlhuang/huang.git
   git push -u origin master

## question£º
created a new repo, cloned it, added files to the directory, added them with add -A, committed changes, 
and when I try to push using git push <repo name> master I get "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have".

This happens if you initialized a new github repo with README and/or LICENSE file
git remote add origin [//your github url]
//pull those changes
git pull origin master
//now, push your work to your new repo
git push origin master
Now you will be able to push your repository to github. Basically, you have to merge those new initialized files with your work. git pull fetches and merges for you. You can also fetch and merge if that suits you.


If you confirm that your new code is all fine you can use:

git push -f origin master.
Where -f stands for "force commit".
